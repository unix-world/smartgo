go 1.22

modified by unixman: r.20250214.2358
	* added SHA-224
	* added SHA-3: 224 / 256 / 384 / 512 ;  quantum computing safe
	* added ed448, EddSA ; quantum computing safe
	* added edx448, EdDSA ; quantum computing safe ; (as ed448 using SHA3-512 instead of SHA3-SHAKE256)
	* added edx25519, EdDSA (as ed25519 using SHA3-512 instead of SHA512)
	* EdDSA (Ed*) refactored with new methods: GenerateEd*PrivateKey() ; GetEd*PublicKeyFromPrivateKeyToBytes() ; GetEd*PublicKeyFromBytes()
	* commented out unsafe algos: HS256 (SHA-256) ; HS512 (SHA-512) ; they are unsafe for signatures, see length attack issue: https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/89561/known-text-attack-on-hash-function-sha-256-or-sha512
	* removed EcDSA: is non-resilient to side-channel attacks, compared with EdDSA
	* removed RSA: old, deprecated, too long for a token with a reasonable safety, compared with EdDSA
	* fix: B63 decoding: add panic handler ; handle invalid padding, L=3
	* fix: expired since error message to avoid display sub-seconds
